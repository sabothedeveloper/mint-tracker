Welcome to the official repository of the RYFT Whitelist Tracker Application Beta. This application serves as a prototype version of our real RYFT Pass application, offering a simplified experience for all users. Use this version to stay updated on selected whitelists and upcoming releases within the web3 project space. With the RYFT Whitelist Tracker, you'll receive notifications that keep you informed about the latest developments in the projects you care about.

## About RYFT

RYFT is a self-employed endeavor founded by a dedicated co-founder, team lead, and frontend developer with a strong passion for web3 technologies. Since its inception in March 2022, RYFT has been dedicated to revolutionizing the way whitelist project management is handled in the web3 ecosystem.

## Key Achievements

- **RYFT Pass Prototype:** Our flagship product, RYFT Pass, has set new standards in web3 project management. While this is a simplified prototype version, it still aims to transform how whitelists are managed and provide users with basic control and insight.

- **Discord Bot Innovation:** Leveraging a solid understanding of Discord bot development using Python, we've developed an innovative solution that automates the process of sending users direct messages about upcoming project releases on our server. This automation enhances user engagement and keeps the community well-informed.

- **Intuitive User Interfaces:** Our team takes pride in delivering intuitive user interfaces for both web and iOS applications. By utilizing React and React Native, we've created interfaces that provide basic notifications on whitelists and upcoming releases. This focus on user experience aims to enhance engagement and user satisfaction.

- **Automated Information Delivery:** Through the implementation of automated information delivery using JavaScirpt (via JavaScript), we've further improved overall user engagement and satisfaction. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about upcoming projects, fostering a more engaged and informed community.
